# Bank of England Speeches Data Analysis Project

As an organisation, the Bank of England is interested in how the trends in these speeches correlate with observed events and economic indicators, as well as how the sentiment of these speeches can be used to predict market behaviour. 

**Who is the Bank of England?**//
The Bank of England's mission is to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability. The Bank of England plays a multifaceted role in the national economy. Its primary objectives include maintaining price stability and supporting the government’s economic policies. To achieve this, the Bank has control over monetary policy instruments, primarily the setting of interest rates. By altering interest rates, the Bank can influence borrowing costs for businesses and individuals, which in turn affects spending, investment, and inflation. 

Internally, the Bank of England has several goals and responsibilities. These include conducting economic research and analysis to inform monetary policy decisions, managing the issuance and circulation of banknotes, supervising and regulating banks and financial institutions to ensure they comply with regulatory standards, and maintaining financial stability through prudent risk management practices. 

The Bank of England's impact extends beyond the UK's borders. As one of the world's leading financial centres, London relies on the Bank's expertise and leadership to maintain the stability of its financial markets. Its influence on global finance is particularly evident in its role in setting standards for financial regulation and its active participation in international forums.

**Scenario**//
Part of the job of the Bank of England is to provide reassurance and stability to financial markets. One way this is achieved is through representatives of the Bank delivering speeches at various public events. As an organisation, the Bank of England is interested in how the trends in these speeches correlate with observed events and economic indicators, as well as how the sentiment of these speeches can be used to predict market behaviour. This analysis will inform our understanding of the impact of the Bank’s communications on the economy, as well as the predictive power of using this data set.
